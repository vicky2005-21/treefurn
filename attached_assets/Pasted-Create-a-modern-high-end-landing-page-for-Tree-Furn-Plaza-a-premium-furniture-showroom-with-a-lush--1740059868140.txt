Create a modern, high-end landing page for Tree Furn Plaza—a premium furniture showroom with a lush, nature-inspired aesthetic. The design must evoke luxury and exclusivity while integrating dynamic animations, interactive features, and a responsive layout optimized for all devices.

Overall Aesthetic & Tone:

Color Palette: Use a blend of rich green and warm brown hues inspired by trees and nature. Incorporate bench-like color elements with added transparency for a refined, organic feel.
Style: Elegant, modern, and luxurious with clean typography, high-quality visuals, and subtle yet engaging animations.
Key Features & Sections:

Navigation Bar:

Desktop:
A slim, fixed top navigation bar with a floating, curved design.
Should stretch across the screen, leaving subtle margins on each side.
Use a blend of bench color and transparency.
Mobile:
A bottom-centered, floating curved navigation bar.
Ensure it adapts responsively, maintaining usability and aesthetics.
Interactivity:
Smooth floating animations on page load.
The navbar should dynamically adjust (stretch and contract) based on screen size and responsiveness.
Single-Page Layout with Section Navigation:

Create a one-page design where “About” and “Contact” are individual sections on the same page.
Users can click on navbar links to smoothly scroll to the respective sections.
Implement animated section transitions (e.g., numbers counting from zero to the final value, content sliding in from below as the user scrolls).
Hero Section:

Background: Full-screen background image or video showcasing the showroom’s elegance.
Headline: “Transform Your Space with Premium Furniture – You Can’t Buy Better Than This!”
Subheadline: “Tirupati’s Largest Furniture Showroom – Explore 5 Floors of Luxury, Custom Designs, and a 5-Year Warranty!”
CTAs: Two buttons labeled “Explore Collections” and “Book a Free Consultation.”
About Section:

Split-screen layout with a high-quality image of the showroom on one side.
Provide a brief history and overview of Tree Furn Plaza, emphasizing quality, custom manufacturing capabilities, and the premium nature of the showroom.
Include a “Contact” section at the bottom of the page for direct access.
Product Showcase / Collections:

Display multiple product categories (e.g., Home Furniture, Office Furniture, Decorative Items) in a grid or carousel format.
Each category (or “collection”) should have a side heading; clicking on it opens a new page or section with more details.
Apply smooth hover effects, fade-in animations, and animated counters (numbers animate from zero to their final value).
Why Choose Us:

Present USPs with icon-based animations. Key points include a 5-year warranty, custom designs, bulk orders, and custom manufacturing capabilities.
Use subtle motion effects to draw attention to each USP.
Testimonials:

Implement a sliding carousel that scrolls through customer reviews.
Incorporate text animations, such as content coming up from below as the user scrolls.
Showroom Location & Contact:

Embed an interactive Google Map to showcase the showroom’s location.
Clearly display contact details and include a feature for visitors to send a WhatsApp message directly.
Tree Animations & Visual Effects:

Integrate smooth tree animations (e.g., gently swaying leaves or branches) throughout the page.
Consider a bench-type animation or background models that enhance the natural theme.
Use parallax scrolling and fade-in effects to create an immersive experience.
Footer:

Include comprehensive contact details, social media links, and a newsletter signup form.
Ensure the footer design remains consistent with the overall green and brown, nature-inspired aesthetic.
SEO & Technical Requirements:

Optimize for fast page load speeds and mobile responsiveness.
Use clean, semantic HTML with appropriate heading hierarchies (H1, H2, etc.).
Include meta tags (title, description) and alt text for all images.
Implement schema markup for local business details to boost local SEO.
Ensure that code is efficient and enhances both user experience and search engine crawlability.
Animations & Interactivity:

Floating Elements: Use smooth floating animations on load (e.g., for the navbar and key CTAs).
Section Transitions: Animate sections as they come into view (e.g., text sliding up, numbers counting dynamically).
Hover & Scroll Effects: Ensure hover animations for product showcases and subtle scroll-triggered animations throughout the page.
Responsive Design:

Desktop: Fixed top navbar that spans the screen with elegant margins, ensuring easy navigation.
Mobile/Tablet: Navbar repositioned to a bottom-centered floating layout, ensuring optimal usability and visual appeal on smaller screens.
