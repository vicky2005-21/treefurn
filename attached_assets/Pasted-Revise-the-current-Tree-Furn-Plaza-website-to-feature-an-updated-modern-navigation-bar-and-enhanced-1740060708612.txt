Revise the current Tree Furn Plaza website to feature an updated, modern navigation bar and enhanced tree-inspired animations that reinforce the nature-inspired, premium aesthetic. This update should blend brown and green color schemes with dynamic animations for an engaging user experience.

Navigation Bar Specifications:

Desktop Version:

Placement & Style:
Implement a slim, fixed navigation bar at the top.
Use a floating, curved design that creates an elegant, high-end feel.
The navbar should have a semi-transparent background that subtly reveals the underlying page, accented with rich brown and green hues.
Responsiveness:
Ensure the navbar stretches across the screen with tasteful margins on both sides.
It must dynamically adjust its width and positioning according to screen size, maintaining a balanced layout on larger monitors.
Animations:
On page load, the navbar should slide or fade in smoothly from the top.
Include hover effects on navigation items (e.g., slight scaling or color transitions to deeper shades of brown or green) to enhance interactivity.
Visual Accents:
Integrate subtle drop shadows or outline effects that enhance the floating effect.
Use a bench-like transparency effect for a refined finish.
Mobile Version:

Placement & Style:
Shift the navigation bar to a bottom-centered, floating curved design.
Maintain the brown and green theme with an even higher level of transparency, ensuring itâ€™s unobtrusive yet visually appealing.
Usability:
Optimize for tap-friendly icons and larger clickable areas.
The mobile navbar should remain consistent in style with the desktop version but be simplified for smaller screens.
Animations:
On mobile, implement a subtle slide-up animation from the bottom when the page loads.
Ensure quick, responsive interactions with animated feedback for link selection.
Tree-Inspired Animations & Visual Effects:

Integrated Tree Elements:

Incorporate delicate tree or leaf animations that interact with the navbar area. For example, small animated leaves or branch silhouettes can gently drift around or overlay the navbar, reinforcing the nature-inspired theme.
Use parallax effects so that these tree elements move at a slightly different speed than the background, adding depth to the design.
Section Transition Animations:

Beyond the navbar, animate section elements (such as collection headings and counter animations) so that numbers count from zero to their target values and text content slides in as users scroll.
Ensure these animations are smooth, consistent, and do not distract from the premium feel.
Color & Style Integration:

The brown and green elements should extend throughout the website. In the navbar, these colors should be prominent yet refined, using transparency and subtle gradients to create a cohesive look.
Ensure that the animations (both tree elements and section transitions) harmonize with the color scheme, evoking the natural elegance of a premium, nature-inspired showroom.
Final Integration Notes:

Overall Consistency:

The updated navbar and animations must blend seamlessly with the existing design, reinforcing the brand identity of Tree Furn Plaza.
Maintain a balance between dynamic interactions and a clean, uncluttered layout, ensuring that animations enhance rather than overwhelm the user experience.
Technical Considerations:

Optimize all animations and interactive elements for performance to ensure fast load times.
Implement responsive design techniques to guarantee a consistent experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
Ensure that the updated elements are accessible (e.g., keyboard navigability, sufficient contrast) and SEO-friendly.
